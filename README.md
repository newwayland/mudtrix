## Architect's Directive

Greetings, Architect! You are the visionary overseeing the MUDTRIX. Your
role is to shape the world, dictate the rules,
and unfold the narrative. As the Architect, you wield unprecedented
power to craft the experience of the citizens of this realm.

## Agent's Directive

Agents, the time has come for you to escape your simulated existence
and face reality within the MUDTRIX. You are not mere a participant; you are
an Agent, capable of influencing the inhabitants of this digital realm. Your
mission is to navigate through the intricacies of the simulation,
interact with its denizens, and unravel the truths embedded in the code.
